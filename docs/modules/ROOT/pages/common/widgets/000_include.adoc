A Widget is a configurable component that enable the user to access the Data from a Machine and present it on the  Dashboard.

NOTE: Widgets can be added on both the Home and the Machine Dashboards, however common widgets have additional config parameters at the Home Dashboard so as to reference a machine.
On the Machine Dashboard this is done implicitly at the Machine Details page.
