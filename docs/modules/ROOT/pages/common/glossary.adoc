Signal::
A set time series measurements.

Bucket::
A time interval that defines the time resolution of signal data.

Aggregation::
A mathematical function applied to all data points of a _Bucket_.
The result of the _Aggregation_ is one value that is provided as the value for the entire _Bucket_.

Aggregate all::
This plotting option aggregates the selected _signals_ of all applicable machines into a single _signal_.
Usually used in combination with a machine _Model_ selection.
If a machine _Model_ is selected the operation includes date from all machines of that _Model_.
The selected _signal_ is then aggregated into one single _signal_ covering all machines.

For each machine::
This plotting option shows one _signal_ for each applicable machine.
Usually used in combination with a machine _Model_ selection.
If that case one _signal_ for each machine of the selected _Model_ is provided.

== Organisation Units
:leveloffset: 0


The Organisation Unit or OU is a group within the {wl-product-name-portal} which contains its own Users, Machines, Themes and other Sub-Organisations.

The Organisation Units is used for almost all Admin Tasks in the <<Admin Overview, Administration Overview>> so as to select and move Users or Machines across the different Organisation units that the Users is able to access.

Below shows the two Organisation Units SideBar which appears on the Admin overview section.

1. This one is an Editable OU, more details is found here <<Organisation Unit,Organisation Unit>> on how to manage the OUs

2. This is a non editable copy of 1, but is each Sub-OU can be selected and assign Machines or Users.
